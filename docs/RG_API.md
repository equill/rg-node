# Restagraph API reference

Note that this is REST-ish, with emphasis on the _ish_.


## Supported HTTP methods

Restagraph makes use of several of the HTTP methods, using their standard meanings according to [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).


### GET

Retrieve the content of one or more resources.

HTTP status code on success is 200 (OK).


### POST

Create a new resource.

HTTP status code on success is 201 (created).


### PUT

Update one or more attributes of a resource.

HTTP status code on success is 204 (no content).


### DELETE

Ensure that a resource is not present.

HTTP status code on success is 204 (no content).



# The Schema API

This describes the types of resources that can be created on "this" instance, and what optional attributes they can have.

It´s the "other half" of the main (raw) API, and is read-only - there is no provision for updating the schema via this API.

Use this to get a description of the available resource-types, in JSON format.


## GET - retrieve the schema

The endpoint base URI is `/schema/v1`:

`GET /schema/v1/` will return a description of all resources.

`GET /schema/v1/<resourcetype>` will return the description of a single resourcetype.


# The Raw API (resources)

This is where you perform most CRUD operations on resources in the database. It´s called "raw" because it doesn´t have any domain-specific logic, like you find in the `files` API (described in the next section). Iẗ́̈́'s expected to serve the majority of your interactions with a Restagraph system.

This API operates on resources, and on the relationships between them. You can create and delete resources, fetch their current state, and update their attributes, and you can create and delete relationships between them. Which attributes are applicable to a given resource depends on its type, which is defined in the schema. Likewise, the schema determines what relationships can be created between any two resource-types.

HTTP return codes are used according to RFC7231, and the Content-type header is set according to whether text or JSON is being returned. As a rule, JSON will be returned on success, and plain text for anything else. The one salient exception is when deleting a resource or relationship, where the MIME-type is "text/plain" and the return code is `NO CONTENT`.

The definitive API reference is in `test/test-rest-api.py`, along with usage examples.

The following patterns are recognised by the application server:


## Create a resource

```
POST /api/v1/<resource-type>/
```

With payload of `uid=<uid>`, plus optionally `<attribute-name>=<value>` pairs for any subset of the attributes defined for this resource type.

The UID must be unique for each resource-type. That is, if you define a `routers` resource and a `switches` resource, no two routers can have the same UID, but a router and a switch can. Bear this in mind when designing your schema.

On success, returns
- status code of 201
- `Location` header containing the URI for the newly-created resource
- body in the form of a JSON object, containing the following fields/attributes:
    - `data` = a nested object containing data representing the resource that was just created
        - `uri` = URI from which the resource's representation can be fetched via GET, and through which it can be deleted via the DELETE method. This is the same URI as is found in the `Location` header, so which of these the client uses is purely a matter of preference.
    - `metadata`' = a nested object mostly containing URLs for actions that can be performed on this object.
        - `attributes` = a list of URIs that can be used to set attributes of the resource, via the PUT method.
        - `relationships` = a list of URIs that can be used to create new relationships to other resources, or query existing relationships.


## Retrieve a resource

```
GET /api/v1/<resource-type>/<uid>
```

Returns a JSON representation of the resource. On success, returns a status code of 200.


## Retrieve all resources of a given type

```
GET /api/v1/<resource-type>/
```

Returns a JSON representation of all resources of that type, with a status code of 200, or 404 if there aren´t any.


## Update one or more attributes of a resource

```
PUT /api/v1/<resource-type>/<resource UID>
```

The payload should be supplied in the request body, POST-style. Among other considerations, this avoids the 1024-character limit for GET-style parameters.

This always returns a status code of 204 (no content) on success.

Although [section 4.3.4 of RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4) states that 201 must be returned "[i]f the target resource does not have a current representation and the PUT successfully creates one," this API provides for updating multiple resources in a single request, making it entirely possible to create, update _and_ delete attributes in a single transaction. It seems like a backward step to restrict clients to updating a single attribute per request, so I´m making the counter-argument that unpopulated attributes have the de facto representation of `Null`, so _technically_ there aren´t any valid resources lacking representation in the context of this method.


## Delete a resource

```
DELETE /api/v1/<resource-type>
```
Requires a payload of `'uid=<uid>'`, and any other parameters are ignored.

Returns 204 (no content) on success.


## Create a relationship from one resource to another
Note that, due to the way Neo4J works, these are always directional.

```
POST /api/v1/<resource-type>/<Unique ID>/<relationship>
with parameter: 'target' = '/type/uid'
```

Parameter _must_ include `type` and `uid`, and _may_ also include `attributes`.

If the destination resource doesn´t already exist, it will be automatically created first. This has to be done as a separate transaction; beware race-conditions where two clients try to create the same thing at the same time.

Returns the URI of the newly-created path through this relationship.


## Retrieve the type and UID of all resources to which this one has a specific relationship
```
GET /api/v1/<resource-type>/<Unique ID>/<relationship>
```


## Delete a relationship to another object
```
DELETE /api/v1/<resource-type>/<Unique ID>/<relationship>/<Unique ID>
```


## Search for objects to which this one has a particular kind of relationship, optionally matching a set of attribute/value pairs
```
GET /api/v1/<resource-type>/<Unique ID>/<relationship>/?<attribute>=<value>
```

Regular expressions based on [Java regexes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) can be used. Negation can be effected by putting `!` at the start of the regex.


## Search for objects with a set relationship to another resource

This is currently limited to one hop.
```
GET /api/v1/<resource-type>?outbound=<relationship>/<resource-type>/<resource-uid>
```

E.g, `GET /api/v1/devices?outbound=BusinessOwner/organisations/Sales`


## Create a resource that depends on another for its context
This is defined in the schema by adding the attribute `dependent=true` to the dependent `rgResource` definition, and by then adding the same attribute to the relationships to that resource-type from resource-types that are valid parents.
It´s valid to create resources that depend on other dependent resources, with no limit to the depth of these chains.
```
POST /api/v1/<parent-type>/<parent-uid>/<relationship-type>
with parameters: 'type=<child-type>' and 'uid=<child-uid>' (both are required)
```


## Delete a dependent resource
Either use the `DELETE` method on the full path to the resource in question to remove it specifically, or pass the `delete-dependent=true` parameter to the API call to one of its parents further up the chain.
The `delete-dependent` parameter acts recursively downward from whatever resource is being deleted.


## Move a dependent resource from one parent to another
Note that the new parent must be a valid parent for the child resource, and the new relationship must also be a valid dependent relationship.
```
POST /api/v1/path/to/dependent/resource
with parameter: 'target=/uri/path/to/new/parent/and/relationship'
```


# Working example

FIXME: `schema goes here`

Create a router:
```
prompt> curl -i -X POST -d 'uid=amchitka' -d 'comment=Router 1' http://localhost:4950/api/v1/routers
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Length: 11
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2016 19:47:57 GMT
Server: Hunchentoot 1.2.35
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

201 /routers/amchitka
```

Retrieve its details:
```
prompt> curl -i http://localhost:4950/api/v1/routers/amchitka
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 39
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2016 19:48:08 GMT
Server: Hunchentoot 1.2.35
Content-Type: application/json

{"uid":"amchitka","comment":"Router 1"}
```

Delete it:
```
prompt> curl -i -X DELETE -d 'uid=amchitka' -d 'comment=Router 1' http://localhost:4950/api/v1/routers
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 2
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2016 19:48:15 GMT
Server: Hunchentoot 1.2.35
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

Confirm that it´s gone:
```
prompt> curl -i http://localhost:4950/api/v1/routers/amchitka
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Length: 40
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2016 19:48:18 GMT
Server: Hunchentoot 1.2.35
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

No routers found with a UID of amchitka.
```

# Files API

Endpoint is `/files/v1`

Three methods are supported:
- POST
- GET
- DELETE

To use them via `curl`:
```
curl -F "file=@/path/to/file.jpg" -F "name=NameOfMyFile" http://localhost:4950/files/v1/
```
